# Collaborative Learning Repository

Welcome to our collaborative learning repository! Here's how we'll structure our learning:

## Repository Structure

1. **Main Branch**: This will contain the problem statements and tests. Each problem (like recreating the .push array method) can be in its own directory with a README file explaining the problem and any tests.

2. **Solution Branches**: Each participant will fork the repository to their own GitHub account. They will solve the problems in their own forked repository, not in branches of the main repository. This way, we avoid having too many branches in the main repository.

3. **Pull Requests for Review**: Once a participant has solved a problem, they can create a pull request against the main repository. The pull request will contain their solution. This way, everyone can review each other's solutions using GitHub's code review tools and give feedback.

4. **Merging Solutions**: After the review process, we can decide whether to merge the solutions into the main repository or keep them in the individual forked repositories.

## Updating Your Forked Repository

You won't have to refork the repository every time a new problem is added. You can simply update your forked repository with the new changes from the main repository. Here's how you can do it:

1. Add the main repository as a remote to your forked repository by running this command in your local clone of your forked repository:
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git
```
Replace `ORIGINAL_OWNER` with the username of the main repository, and `ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY` with the name of the main repository.

2. Fetch the new changes from the main repository by running:
```bash
git fetch upstream
```

3. Merge these changes into your local branch:
```bash
git merge upstream/main
```
Replace `main` with the name of the branch in the main repository that contains the new problem.

4. Push these changes to your forked repository on GitHub:
```bash
git push origin main
```
Replace `main` with the name of your local branch where you want to push these changes.

This way, you'll have all new problems in your forked repositories without having to re-fork or create a new clone.

## Avoiding Merge Conflicts

Merge conflicts occur when changes conflict with each other, i.e. when the same part of your code is altered in two different ways. If you're only adding new files (your solutions) and not modifying existing ones from the main repository, then you should not encounter merge conflicts when updating your forked repositories.

However, if you do modify existing files from the main repository and those files have been updated in the main repository, you might encounter merge conflicts when trying to update your forked repositories. In such cases, you would need to resolve these conflicts manually.

Remember, good communication and coordination can help avoid most merge conflicts. For instance, agreeing not to modify certain files or coordinating who works on what can go a long way in preventing conflicts.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
